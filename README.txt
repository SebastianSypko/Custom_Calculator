To work, the calculator must be opened with VisualStudio via the Live Server extension

The operation of the calculator:
-Firstly user has to select all numbers and operations which he wants (User can't select elements which are needed to work in the final calculator)
-When he chose all element which he wants (them are red color) user needs to click 'Make Customized Calculator' button
-Then user see final calculator on which he can handle operations
-If user wants to customized calculator again he needs to reload the page

Things to improve:
- function adaptArea was written really poorly becuase of the lack of time, it should be much more simple function to handle grid change
- there are too many things going on in the code, probably some more simple functions should be nested in each other to avoid big amount of them
- in exercise description there is not detailed which numbers in the power function should be natural number so i've made both base and exponent 
needed to be natural, if only base number was supose to be natural then this is a change that needs to be made
